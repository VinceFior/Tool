# Tool
My personal utility for important tasks like opening reaction .gifs and music videos. 
I'll come up with a better name later. 


This multi-purpose tool has a number of distinct commands, listed below. My favorites are "gif" and "ytmusic".
While most of these commands are silly or small, I hope to add more meaningful commands 
so the tool becomes more like a miniature digital assistant.


## How to install

Move the `Tool.app` file to your Applications folder.
You can open the Tool by clicking on the gear icon in the menu bar or by pressing `CMD`+`\`. 
However, to use the keyboard shortcut you need to give the application accessibility permissions. 
Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility and add `Tool.app` 
under "Allow the apps below to control your computer".


## Commands

"settings" or "config" to open settings folder

"gif <keyword>" to copy the URL of a reaction image, like "gif nope"

"list gif" to list all reaction images

"getalbum <album ID>" to generate a list of reaction images for the given album

"updatealbum" to update the image-database.txt file

"dict <word>" to open Dictionary.com to the given word

"xkcd <keyword>" to open the first xkcd.com result for the given keyword

"ytmusic <keyword>" to open the first matching video on my YouTube 'Music' playlist

"youtube <keyword>" to search YouTube for the given keyword

"music <keyword>" to search my Google Play Music library for the given keyword

"google <keyword>" to search Google for the given keyword

"school <class>" to open the folder for my given class in Finder

"syl <class>" to open the syllabus for my given class in Finder


### Notes

To use all the commands, you need an API key for Imgur and for YouTube. Both can be obtained for free.
